# pippm
A python package manager for pip

The goal of this repository is to make it easy for the average person to install package dependencies, create tests, with colorful printing and a rich output which can be viewed by anyone in a terminal

#Getting Started

```py -m pip install pippm```

This will automagically install the latest version of pippm for your version of python

#Usage
